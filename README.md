# voting-machine-mapping

## Rationale
In Texas, elections are administered at the county level. The State of Texas has a pre-approved list of voting machines that can be bought and implemented at each county's discretion. This project aims to highlight regional differences in voting machines across counties in Texas. This will help us:
- Understand the prevelance of known vulnurabilities (e.g. how many voters are potentially affected by a specific security flaw?)
- Make recommendations for the security, maintainence, and eventual upgrade of voting machines
- Prepare voters with hyper-specific sample ballots that match the machine in their county

## To Do
### Research
Our data is helpful, but incomplete. We will need help to:
- Determine age of each voting machine and its version
- Determine which threats exist to currently deployed voting machines
- Examine the union of existant, known threats and deployed voting machines
