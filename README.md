# voting-machine-mapping

## Rationale
This project aim to highlight faults or vulnurabilities in Texas' voting machines, and visualize their locations. 
What vulnurabilities does Texas' stable of Voting Machines face? Where do those vulnurable machines exist? Who is being marginalized as a result? 


## To Do
### Research
Our data is helpful, but incomplete. We will need help to:
- Determine age of each voting machine and its version
- Determine which threats exist to currently deployed voting machines
- Examine the union of existant, known threats and deployed voting machines
